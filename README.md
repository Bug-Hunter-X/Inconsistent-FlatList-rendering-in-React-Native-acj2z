# Inconsistent FlatList rendering in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList component in React Native inconsistently renders an empty list, even when data is successfully fetched from an API.  The issue occurs intermittently, making it difficult to debug.

## Bug Description

A FlatList is used to display data fetched from a JSONPlaceholder API.  While the data fetch is successful, the FlatList sometimes fails to render the items, displaying an empty list instead.  The inconsistency makes it hard to identify a consistent pattern or trigger.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run the app using a React Native CLI.
4. Observe the inconsistent behavior of the FlatList.
